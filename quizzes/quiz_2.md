# QUIZ[2]

1.) How does one get the third value in a list named `drinks`?

2.) How does one get the second-to-last value in a list named `drinks`?

3.) What is printed when the following code block is run?

```
words = ["banana", "fruit", "fly", "flies", "time", "arrow", "clock", "house"]
print(f"{words[4]} {words[3]} like an {words[5]}; {words[1]} {words[3]} like a {words[0]}")
```

4.) Write at least 1 line of code that gets the first value in the `recipe` list of the `Rad Roach` from the following `drinks` dictionary:

```
drinks = {
	"Bad Touch": {
		"owner": "none",
		"recipe": [0,2,2,2,1,0,0],
		"karm": [4,4]
	},
	"Hawaiian Skyline": {
		"owner": "SkylineGazer",
		"recipe": [0,9,2,3,1,0,0],
		"karm": [4,4]
	},
	"Rad Roach": {
		"owner": "AKay74u",
		"recipe": [2,0,1,6,0,0,0],
		"karm": [10,10]
	}
}
```

5.) Expand the `drinks` dictionary above to include a fourth drink named `Sugar Rush`, with `owner` set to `none`, `recipe` set to `[2,0,1,0,0,0,0]`, and `karm` set to `[0,17]`, and write out the entire updated `drinks` dictionary.
